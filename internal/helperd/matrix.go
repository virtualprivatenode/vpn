// ── The freshness matrix ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The staging board's one failure mode is staleness: an
// operation changes reality and the board file carrying the old
// fact survives. The defense is this table. It maps each verb
// to the board facts that verb invalidates, and restage(verb)
// — called by every handler as part of its postcondition — is
// driven BY the table, so the mapping is the mechanism, not
// documentation that can drift from it.
//
// Reading the matrix: a verb not listed here invalidates no
// staged fact (a package upgrade changes no staged credential).
// One entry is conditional: service-action invalidates the
// staged LND TLS certificate only when the unit acted on is
// lnd — the handler applies the entry under that condition,
// because the verb-keyed table cannot see verb parameters. The
// unit tests in matrix_test.go walk every cell: every listed
// fact has a stager, every stager is reachable from a verb or
// the installer's staging step, and the sets match this table
// exactly.

// stagers maps each board file to the function that refreshes
// it from current reality. All run as root.

// ── Freshness declarations ───────────────────────────────
//
// Every fact the TUI consumes has exactly one declared
// freshness story, and matrix_test.go fails on any board file
// without one — a contributor adding a new fact is stopped by
// a red test asking "how does this stay fresh?". The stories:
//
//   - watched: the fact's source can change autonomously (no
//     operation of ours involved), and a systemd path unit on
//     the source triggers a re-stage within seconds, before
//     any human shows up to read a stale copy.
//   - healed: the fact is a credential that fails CLOSED at
//     the moment of use when stale (the cryptography rejects
//     it, in front of the calling code), and the consumer
//     repairs the failure by asking for a re-stage and
//     retrying once, rate-limited process-wide.
//   - live-read: no copy exists at all. The fact is a display
//     or safety observation whose staleness would produce no
//     failure to repair from, so screens read it through a
//     read-only verb at human cadence (liveReadFacts below).
//   - static-by-decision: the fact changes only through
//     covered operations (install, a menu verb); foreign
//     change is possible for root but is not promisable, and
//     divergence surfaces as an honest, named error — never a
//     silent false success.

	// Regenerated only by a Syncthing (re)install, which the
	// syncthing-install verb covers. The one foreign surface
	// that can change it — the Syncthing web UI — produces an
	// HTTP 403 that every REST wrapper now fails loudly on,
	// so divergence is an immediate honest error.
